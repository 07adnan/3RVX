Skinning 3RVX
=============

3RVX allows for its interface to be changed through customizable skins. Each part of the user interface can be skinned, including:
* The on-screen displays (OSDs): Volume, Eject, etc.
* Control sliders
* The system notification icons (system tray)
* Sound effects

The following figure illustrates these components.
